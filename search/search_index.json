Start traversing from the second element. Compare each element with the current maximum. If the current element is greater, update the maximum. After finishing traversal, the stored value is the maximum element. This avoids unnecessary sorting and gives an optimal solution. \ud83d\udcbb Solution (Python) def find_max(arr): max_element = arr[0] for num in arr: if num > max_element: max_element = num return max_element --- ### \u23f1 Time & Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(n) : We scan the array once where n is number of elements. Space Complexity: O(1) : No extra space is used. --- ## \u2705 Problem 2: Reverse an Array ### \ud83d\udccc Problem Statement Given an array, reverse the elements and return the reversed array. --- ### \ud83d\udca1 Approach Use Python slicing to reverse the array. --- ### \ud83e\udde0 Detailed Explanation Python provides slicing which allows accessing elements in reverse order using [::-1]. Steps: 1. Start from last index. 2. Move backwards. 3. Collect elements into a new array. This produces a reversed array in a single step. --- ### \ud83d\udcbb Solution (Python) ```python def reverse_array(arr): return arr[::-1] \u23f1 Time & Space Complexity Time Complexity: O(n) : Each element is accessed once.
